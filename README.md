*Project Title:* Consumer Loan Assistant

**Project Description:**

**Overview:**
The Consumer Loan Assistant project is a Java-based application developed using Microsoft Visual Code Studio and Swings. It serves as a valuable tool for managing consumer debt by facilitating calculations related to loan payments and loan terms based on user-provided balance and interest information.

**Features:**
1. **Input Loan Information:** Users can input their loan balance and yearly interest rate to initiate the calculation process.

2. **Payment Calculation:** The application offers two distinct calculation options:
   - *Option 1:* Users can specify the number of payments they intend to make, and the loan assistant will calculate the corresponding monthly payment amount.
   - *Option 2:* Alternatively, users can input their desired monthly payment amount, and the loan assistant will determine the number of payments required to pay off the loan.

3. **Comprehensive Analysis:** The Consumer Loan Assistant not only provides payment details but also offers a comprehensive analysis of the loan. This analysis includes:
   - Total payments over the course of the loan.
   - Total interest paid on the loan.

**Project Implementation:**
The project has been developed and implemented as a standalone application named "Consumer_Loan_Assistant."

By using this application, individuals can gain a better understanding of their consumer debt and make informed decisions about their loan repayment strategies.

This project is an excellent opportunity for Java interns to enhance their programming skills while contributing to a valuable financial tool. It enables interns to work with Swing for creating a graphical user interface and perform complex loan calculations.
